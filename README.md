# SLAM-Based-Robotic-Tank
The project falls within the realm of robotics and autonomous navigation. This robot is capable of self-guided exploration using Simultaneous Localization  and Mapping (SLAM) technology. The robot navigates and map unknown  environments without human intervention, using a variety of sensors for obstacle  avoidance and real-time mapping.
Project Title
“SLAM-Based Autonomous Robotic Tank”

## Problem
 Autonomous navigation in dynamic and unstructured environments is a major challenge
 for robotics. Many real-world applications, like search and rescue, warehouse
 management, and environmental monitoring, require robots to explore and map areas
 without human assistance. Our robot will address this problem by building accurate maps
 while avoiding obstacles, making it suitable for complex, real-world environments.
## Solution
 The proposed solution is an autonomous robot that integrates LIDAR, ultrasonic
 sensors, IMU (motion tracking), and a night-vision camera. It will autonomously
 explore, build maps, and avoid obstacles in real time using SLAM algorithms. The robot
 will use Raspberry Pi for control and processing, with the ultimate goal of creating an
 efficient, autonomous explorer.
## Results
 The robot can:
 - Map its surroundings and localize itself in real time.
 - Detect and avoid obstacles autonomously.
 - Capture environmental data via the camera.
 - Navigate to specific targets while continuously updating its map.
